My research paper

Chinese, a language derived from pictographs, is essentially different from English or other phonetic languages. For Chinese, one of the most unique is that the character system of Chinese is based on hieroglyphics, which has the raw meanings. That is to say, not only words and characters can express specific meanings, but also radicals are important carriers of semantics. 

If you are interseted in Chinese natural language processing, welcome refer to and cite our paper which has been published in AAAI-19: https://aaai.org/ojs/index.php/AAAI/article/view/4446
